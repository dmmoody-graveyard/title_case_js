Title Case
==========

Title Case is a web page where a user can input a name and it converts it to title case (the first letter of each word capitalized).

Epicodus Coursework Objectives
------------------------------

Make a web page where a user can input a name and it converts it to title case (the first letter of each word capitalized). There are a lot of rules to title casing - think about words like the and and.

Remember to start off simple. I like to pick the simplest possible behavior and write a spec for it, make it pass, and then pick the next simplest behavior. Here, I might start with a one-word title, and then return it back with the first letter capitalized. Next, I might write a spec for a one-word title that's all lower-case, and return back in title case. And so on.

By the time you finish, make sure your code can handle inputs in all lowercase, all uppercase, a mix of different cases, one word, multiple words, and anything else you can think of.
